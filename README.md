# Iron Boy

A GameBoy emulator, written in Rust.

In my quest to build a GBA emulator in Rust, I made a Game Boy emulator in Rust.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have the latest version of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed

### Mac OS with homebrew

`brew install sdl2`

### Ubuntu

`sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y libsdl2`

### Running

`cargo run <rom file path>`

- You can also build a release and run the executable as well

## Keymappings

| Joypad | Keyboard    |
| ------ | ----------- |
| A      | X           |
| B      | Z           |
| Start  | Space       |
| Select | Enter       |
| Up     | Up Arrow    |
| Down   | Down Arrow  |
| Left   | Left Arrow  |
| Right  | Right Arrow |

## Tests

### Blargg's tests

| Test         | Status |
| ------------ | ------ |
| cpu instrs   | :+1:   |
| instr timing | :+1:   |

\* Other Blargg tests failing or can not test due to not supporting CGB at the moment

### DMG Acid test
